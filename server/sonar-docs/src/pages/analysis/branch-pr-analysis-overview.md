_Merge and Pull Request analysis is available as part of [Developer Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html) and [above](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/)._

SonarScanners running in GitLab CI/CD, Azure Pipelines, Cirrus CI, and Jenkins with a Branch Source plugin configured can automatically detect branches and merge or pull requests by using environment variables set in the jobs.

[[warning]]
| Automatic configuration is disabled if any branch or pull request properties have been set manually.
